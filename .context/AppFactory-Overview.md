# What is AppFactory?

AppFactory is a PaaS (platform as a service) for custom application development, maintenance and hosting.

# What is AppFactory used for?

Organizations use AppFactory to build ecosystems of custom applications that automate their processes. AppFactory is specifically designed for organizations that strategically use AI to enhance their workforce capabilities rather than replace their people.

# Framework

## Modular UI Components

Application designers build applications "lego" style using a growing library of pre-built UI components. They create applications rapidly without programming or debugging UI elements. Users who learn the basic interface can easily adapt when operational changes occur or when they transfer to different departments.

## Enterprise-wide Security

Users receive systems that appear fully customized to their individual workflows. This customization is particularly valuable for collaboration across departments and organizations.

## Unified Data Architecture

All process automations are hosted within a common data storage layer. This gives leadership real-time visibility across processes and departments for reporting, analysis, and decision support without expensive system integrations.

## Shared Modules

The framework features an expanding collection of pre-built modules that enhance custom applications without requiring additional design or programming.

- Ad-hoc query reporting
- AI Agent - Design
- AI Agent - User Assistant
- Dashboard (dynamic tasks, widgets)
- Data visualization (graphing)
- Drill down (bookmarks, tasks, reporting)
- Messaging
- OAuth2
- Performance Management (OKRs/KPIs)
- Reporting (ad-hoc query)
- Reporting (prebuilt)

## Vertical Applications

The framework includes a growing library of pre-built, integrated applications that organizations can implement to enhance their operations without needing additional design or programming.

- Announcements
- Appreciation (customer, prospect, staff)
